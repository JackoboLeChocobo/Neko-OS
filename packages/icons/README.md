# Faenza Icon Library

Faenza Icon Library is an Icon Set of 4,208 icons. It's been open sourced with the license: GNU General Public License v3.0. All icons can be used for personal & commercial purposes.

More details: This massive library (named Faenza Icon Library) is not going to be your go-to icon set. This is because while there are thousands (literally) of professionally designed icons, the intention behind this library was to provide a theme for a software application. All that being said, you'll be able to find some unique icons in this library for your one-off needs.
